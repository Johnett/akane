# Akane 

[ah·KAH·nay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akane) (あかね, アカネ) is the Japanese female name or a word for 'deep red' (Redd·it). 

## Motivations
This project is my way to explore Android Framework and new third-party libraries and see them work together in MVVM pattern to test all together.
This project is my dojo; I am not trying to build another replica for Reddit app. But I am going to add new feature weekly to this app to see where it goes.






## Architecture 
The database (Room) is the single source of truth in this pattern. Any change or action has to be applied to the database to be reflected on the UI changes.
